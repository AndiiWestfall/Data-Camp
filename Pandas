import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('../_datasets/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv')

# Print the minimum value of the Engineering column
print(df["Engineering"].min())

# Print the maximum value of the Engineering column

# Construct the mean percentage per year: mean
mean = df.mean(axis="columns")

# Plot the average percentage per year
mean.plot()

Median vs mean
In many data sets, there can be large differences in the mean and median value due to the presence of outliers.
In this exercise, you'll investigate the mean, median, and max fare prices paid by passengers on the Titanic and generate a box plot of the fare prices. This data set was obtained from Vanderbilt University.
All necessary modules have been imported and the DataFrame is available in the workspace as df.

# Print summary statistics of the fare column with .describe()
print(df["fare"].describe())

# Generate a box plot of the fare column
df["fare"].plot(kind="box")

# Show the plot
plt.show()

Quantiles
In this exercise, you'll investigate the probabilities of life expectancy in countries around the world. This dataset contains life expectancy for persons born each year from 1800 to 2015. Since country names change or results are not reported, not every country has values. This dataset was obtained from Gapminder.
First, you will determine the number of countries reported in 2015. There are a total of 260 unique countries in the entire dataset. Then, you will compute the 5th and 95th percentiles of life expectancy over the entire dataset. Finally, you will make a box plot of life expectancy every 50 years from 1800 to 2000. Notice the large change in the distributions over this period.
The dataset has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame called df.

# Print the number of countries reported in 2015
print(df["2015"].count())

# Print the 5th and 95th percentiles
print(df.quantile([0.05, 0.95]))

# Generate a box plot
years = ['1800','1850','1900','1950','2000']
df[years].plot(kind='box')
plt.show()

Let's use the mean and standard deviation to explore differences in temperature distributions in Pittsburgh in 2013. The data has been obtained from Weather Underground.
In this exercise, you're going to compare the distribution of daily temperatures in January and March. You'll compute the mean and standard deviation for these two months. You will notice that while the mean values are similar, the standard deviations are quite different, meaning that one month had a larger fluctuation in temperature than the other.
The DataFrames have been pre-loaded for you as january, which contains the January data, and march, which contains the March data.
Compute and print the means of the January and March data using the .mean() method.
Compute and print the standard deviations of the January and March data using the .std() method.

# Print the mean of the January and March data
print(january.mean(), march.mean())

# Print the standard deviation of the January and March data
print(january.std(), march.std())
